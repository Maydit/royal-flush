The script is equiped with 2 classes, User and Poker, these classes are capable of most actions within royal flush. 

In the current version of the script (v1.0) the script will do the following:
1) create 4 new accounts 
2) login with those accounts 
3) create a game and join the game 
4) play 5 rounds of the game 
5) logout of the game, and print the player info

you can view this interaction live by commenting out line 43, if you want to just run a lighter weight version of the tests, uncomment line 43 for a headless (no visible browse) mode.
